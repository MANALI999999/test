# Knowledge Enhancement & Career Advancement With MOOC

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) data to uncover insights into user engagement, course effectiveness, and factors influencing successful course completion. Utilizing R for comprehensive data analysis, we explore various statistical and machine learning models to predict course outcomes and identify key predictors of learner success.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and transformation of MOOC data for analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Spearman and Pearson correlations to uncover relationships between variables.
- **Regression Analysis:** Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models to predict continuous outcomes.
- **Random Forest Regression:** Analysis to predict outcomes and assess feature importance.
- **Logistic Regression:** Model to predict binary outcomes (e.g., course completion) with evaluation at different probability thresholds.

## Technologies Used

- R and RStudio
- Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, ggcorrplot, corrplot, Metrics, hydroGOF, e1071, glmnet, kernlab, rpart, randomForest, gbm

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. Additionally, the following R packages are required:


### Running the Analysis

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R project in RStudio.
3. Run the script `analysis.R` to perform the data analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset includes user engagement data from various MOOCs, encompassing demographics, course interaction metrics, and completion outcomes. Note: The dataset used in this project is synthetic and designed for educational purposes.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the analysis or extend the dataset are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
